"""
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:
[[1,3,1],
 [1,5,1],
 [4,2,1]]
Given the above grid map, return 7. Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.

"""
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
"""
Time complexity : O(n + m)O(n+m)

Space complexity : O(1)O(1)

The iterative approach only allocates a few pointers, so it has a constant overall memory footprint.
